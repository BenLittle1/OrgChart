## üìã Configuration Files

### `railway.json`
- Configures build and deployment settings
- Sets up health checks and environment variables
- Uses Nixpacks builder for optimal performance

### `next.config.ts`
- Optimized for Railway deployment
- Enables standalone output for better performance
- Configures image optimization and security headers

### `package.json`
- Includes all necessary build scripts
- Specifies Node.js version requirements
- Configured for Railway's build process

## üîß Local Testing

Test production build locally before deploying:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to test the production build.

## üöÄ Deployment Process

Railway will automatically:
1. Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
2. Run TypeScript type checking
3. Build the Next.js application (`npm run build`)
4. Start the production server (`npm start`)

## üìä Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard
- View deployment logs
- Monitor resource usage
- Configure scaling settings
